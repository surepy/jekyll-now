title: draft: how to properly update All of Fabric 4 modpack server (because nobody tells me how to) 
---

back up the world AND CONFIGS!!!!!!

download the latest server pack from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-4/files/3534124

investigate server-setup-config.yaml, and overwrite it probably

delete serverstarter.lock

launch startserver.sh

stop the server

restore your changed configs or added mods from backup or OLD_TO_DELETE

restart the server

this took way too long to figure out
