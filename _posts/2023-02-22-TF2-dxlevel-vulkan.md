it's 2023/2/17, and I was having a chat with "pony goon"

they suggested me to use dx8 for better performance and due to the sniper scope fish eye effect.

After procrastinating a bit, I finally tried it and it was pretty good honestly, much more pleasurable to aim

but then it hit me.

I remembered listening on the WAN show about how dxvk was improving game performance in windows, and how it was awesome how a linux software is yadda yadda... 

... and decided to add 1 + 1 and put that to the test; first in dx9 as dx8 to vulkan isn't an option.

I noticed my frame stability was improved like.. ***a LOT.***

I was hitting much more shots because of how smooth everything was; it was kind of insane.
